# Challenge 6: Fibonacci Series
Write a C++ program that takes an integer n as input from the user and prints the Fibonacci series up to the nth term. The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, usually starting with 0 and 1.

Your program should prompt the user to enter the value of n and then display the Fibonacci series up to the nth term.
