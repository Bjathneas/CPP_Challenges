# Challenge: Palindrome Check

Write a function that takes a string as input and checks whether it is a palindrome. A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward, disregarding spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.

# Requirements:

* The function should take a string as input and return a boolean indicating whether it is a palindrome.
* The function should ignore spaces, punctuation, and capitalization when checking for a palindrome.
* The function should handle both uppercase and lowercase letters correctly.

# Example:
Input: "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"
Output: true

# Note:
The input string "A man, a plan, a canal: Panama" is a palindrome because it reads the same forward and backward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization.
