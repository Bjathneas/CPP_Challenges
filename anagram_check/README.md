# Challenge: Anagram Check

Write a function that takes two strings as input and checks whether they are anagrams of each other. Anagrams are words or phrases formed by rearranging the letters of another word or phrase.

# Requirements:

* The function should take two strings as input and return a boolean indicating whether they are anagrams.
* The function should handle both uppercase and lowercase letters correctly.
* The function should consider whitespace and punctuation when checking for anagrams.
* The function should have an efficient algorithm to determine if the strings are anagrams.

# Example:
Input: "listen", "silent"
Output: true

# Note:
The input strings "listen" and "silent" are anagrams because they contain the same letters arranged in different orders.
